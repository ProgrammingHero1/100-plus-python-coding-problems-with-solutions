# max of two

## The problem

Find the max number of two numbers.

## Hints

Ask the user to enter two numbers.

Then, you can run a comparison to compare which one is larger.

Think about it and try yourself first.

## Solution

```python
num1 = int(input("First number: "))
num2 = int(input("Second number: "))
if (num2 >= num1):
    largest = num2
else:
    largest = num1
print("Largest number you entered is: ", largest)
```

## Shortcut

Another simple and alternative solution is to send the numbers to the max function.

```python
num1 = int(input("First number: "))
num2 = int(input("Second number: "))
largest = max(num1, num2)
print("Largest number you entered is: ", largest)
```

## Alternative Solution

Another alternative approach is to use the floor method from the math module. If you pass a number with a fraction to the math.floor function, it will return you the integer part of the number.

For example,

```python
import math
result = math.floor(3.4)
print(result)
```

## Another way to solve the problem

So what we are going to do is to define a function that takes 2 parameters, a and b.
We are using an if..else statement.
If a is greater or less than b then a is the max number or else B is the max number.

**Test Case-**

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 9
Largest number you entered is 10
```

```python
def maxof2Numbers( a, b):
    if a>=b:
        return a
    else:
        return b

a = int(input('Enter the first number: '))
b = int(input('Enter the second number: '))

largest = maxof2Numbers(a , b)
print(f"Largest number you entered is {largest}")
```
